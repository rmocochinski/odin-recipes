        <p>A wonderful baked creme brulee. Use white or brown sugar for the top.
        If you do not have a kitchen torch, a regular propane torch can be used
        or simply place the custard under the broiler for a few minutes.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 egg yolks</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>        
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and line the
            bottom of a large baking pan with a damp kitchen cloth.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to boil. While water is boiling,
            combine cream, 1/4 cup sugar and salt in saucepan over medium heat.
            Stir occasionally 4 to 5 minutes, until steam rises. In a medium
            bowl, beat egg yolks and vanilla until smooth. Pour hot cream into
            yolks, a little at a time, stirring constantly, until all cream is
            incorporated. Pour mixture into four 6 oz. ramekins.</li>
            <li>Place ramekins on towel in baking dish, and place dish on oven
            rack. Pour boiling water into dish to halfway up the sides of the
            ramekins. Cover whole pan loosely with foil.</li>
            <li>Bake 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until custard is
            just set. Chill ramekins in refrigerator 4 to 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Before serving, sprinkle 1 tablespoon sugar over each custard.
            Use a kitchen torch or oven broiler to brown top, 2 to 3
            minutes.</li>
        </ol>
