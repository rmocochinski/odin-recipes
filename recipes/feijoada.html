    <img src="../images/feijoada.jpg" alt="Black beans with white rice and bacon" width="490">
    <p>This feijoada recipe is my version of a traditional Brazilian black bean
    stew that maintains the rich smoky, flavors famous in Brazil. Additional
    meats, including sausage, may be added if desired. This is excellent served
    over brown rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups chopped onion</li>
            <li>1/2 cup green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package dry black beans, soaked overnight</li>
            <li>2 smoked ham hocks</li>
            <li>8 ounces diced ham</li>
            <li>1/2 pound thickly sliced bacon, diced</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves, crushed</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fresh chopped cilantro</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>        
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add 3/4 cup chopped
            onion, green onions, and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about
            4 minutes. Pour in soaked beans and fill with enough water to cover
            beans by 3 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low,
            and simmer uncovered for 2 hours, or until tender.</li>
            <li>While beans are cooking, place ham hocks in a smaller pot with
            1/4 cup chopped onion. Cover with water and simmer until meat pulls
            off of the bone easily, about 1 hour. Drain and add to beans.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place ham, bacon, and remaining onion in a baking dish. Bake
            until mixture is crispy, 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain bacon and ham mixture and add to beans. Season with bay
            leaves, coriander, salt, and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes
            more.</li>
            <li>Stir in chopped cilantro and parsley just before serving.</li>
        </ol>
